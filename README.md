### Hello!

I'm working on an end-to-end video pipeline for asynchronous "event" data. This includes (or will include) transcoders for multiple camera types, lossy compression, source modeled arithmetic coding, adaptive rate control driven by bandwidth and application directives, a streaming protocol, and native client-side applications. You can find this repository [here](https://github.com/ac-freeman/adder-codec-rs).

My contact information and infrequent updates may be found on my [website](acfreeman.dev).
